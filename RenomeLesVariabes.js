    const LinkProfilPicture = "http://www.go.com/davif.png"; // ❌ the variable name is not explicit and the keyword is missing (this is David's profile picture)
  
    let Address = "San Francisco"; // ❌ the variable name is not explicit and the keyword is missing (try to guess what "San Francisco" could refer to)
  
    let Followers = 109; // ❌ the keyword to declare the variable is missing 
    var Following = 200; // ❌ the keyword to declare the variable is missing
